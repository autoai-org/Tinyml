Overview
===================================

I wrote Tinynet for educational purpose, and I found it is useful and interesting to figure out what is a deep learning framework doing under sophisticated apis. I hope this project can be useful for students to understand deep learning.

The principles for designing Tinynet are as following:

**Modular**. There are many different trials in running a working example of deep learning framework, but few of them are trying to be modular, and as a result, it is usually hard to add/remove things inside.
