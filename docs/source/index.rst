Welcome to Tinynet's documentation!
===================================

Tinynet is a small framework for writing neural networks for educational purposes. It is written in pure Python with some help from third party libraries, such as numpy, tqdm, etc. I hope this is a good source for learning neural networks and deep learning.

There might be some errors and deficiencies, and these are all my fault. If you
meet any of them, please kindly leave your comments at `GitHub Issue Tracker
<https://github.com/xzyaoi/tinynet/issues>`_. If you are not comfortable with
publicly accessible issues, please drop an email to `askxzyao@gmail.com <mailto:askxzyao@gmail.com>`_.
