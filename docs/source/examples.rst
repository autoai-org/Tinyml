In this chapter, we will present three examples:

-  A manually set neural networks. We will compute the training process
   by hand, and compare it with the result from TinyNet.

-  The hand written digits recognition with both fully connected neural
   networks and convolutional neural networks in TinyNet.

-  The cat classifier built with Tinynet.
